Data in csv is of following format:
1. Row 1 for radial coordinate of thermocouple in (m)
2. Row 2 for axial coordinate of thermocouple in (m)
3. Row 5 onwards, column 1 is for time step (hr) and subsequent columns are thermocouple temperatures in (degC) for respective radial and axial coordinates mentioned in row 1 and 2.
